- 👋 Hi, I’m Danush. Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computational Materials Science at TU Freiberg.
- 👀 I’m interested on the application of machine learning methods for material discovery. Also I'm interested to work on 3D graphics, visualizations and high performance computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about GANs for synthetic data generation and, also diving into CNN for microstructure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on topics related to imaging techniques and parallel computing.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on danushkumar095@gmail.com.
